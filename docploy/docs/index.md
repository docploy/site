# Overview

Docploy is a documentation platform used to integrate your technical documentation and code ("docs-as-code") <use a tool tip here> together.

Current documentation solutions include Markdown site generators on one end and Wiki knowledge bases on the other end. Both are fine solutions for sharing static knowledge quickly. But, there are many manual tasks involved with maintaining documentation that can consume peoples' time. When left unchecked, documentation can quickly grow out of control:

- Wasting time scheduling checks to ensure that documentation is correct
- Ensuring that code snippets are always working
- Enforcing grammar and syntax standards
- Enforcing the same structure for all documentation pages
- Leaving unused and outdated documentation can be a time sink and cause confusion for users

# About Docploy

Docploy is a documentation platform built to integrate your documentation and code together. It works with your continuous integration platform to do the following:

- Deploys your `docploy/docs/` folder onto its own dedicated site
- Checks your code snippets are always working
- Enforces a consistent style guide
- Recommends grammar and syntax

We make it easy to build and maintain your documentation so you can guarantee a high quality developer experience.

You can save your developers' time because they will no longer need to perform routine checks to make sure how-to instructions are still valid. You can save your users' time beause they won't need to scratch their head wondering if they did something wrong when the documentation is out of date.

# Comparison

Other documentation solutions include static site generators on one end and Wiki platforms on the other end. Both are fine solutions for sharing static knowledge quickly. But, there are many manual tasks involved with maintaining documentation that can consume your developers' time. When left unchecked, documentation can quickly grow out of control.

## Wikis

Wikis provide a good solution for storing and reading static content. You can quickly create a new document. But, they can quickly turn into a wild west scenario as the number of documents scale up. They tend to store stale code, which can confuse onboarding or veteran users and cause them to waste their time trying to debug the root cause of the issue. Wikis live independently of your code, so when a breaking code change is introduced, many Wiki pages can go out of date.

## Static Site Generators

Static site generators are a good solution for keeping your documentation tied to your code. But, you need to set up and maintain your code and tooling. There is an opportunity cost for spending time on documentation when you could be building out your product instead. Static site generators also suffer from the same drawbacks as Wikis: code can get outdated, lack of a consistent page structure, and lack of grammar/syntax validation.

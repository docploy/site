You can add a callout to emphasize information that breaks the flow of the page.

## Add the callout

The following syntax renders a callout:

```yaml
{% callout
  type="warning"
  content="Hi, I am here to warn you about something very important!"
%}
```

{% callout
  type="warning"
  content="Hi, I am here to warn you about something very important!"
%}
